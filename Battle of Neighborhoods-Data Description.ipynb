In other words, the records in this type of information set have coordinates, an address, city, postal code, or zip code included with them. The most obvious example is a road map. We see the rendered result, but the features on the map are stored with this type of information included in them.\n\nThere are two basic types or forms of geospatial data:\n\nVector - This form uses points, lines, and polygons to represent spatial features such as cities, roads, and streams.\n\nRaster - This form uses cells (computers often use dots or pixels) to represent spatial features. Cities are single cells, roads are linear sequences of cells, and streams are collections of adjacent cells. An example of this is remote satellite data."
